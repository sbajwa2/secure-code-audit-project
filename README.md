# Survey Form – Code Security Audit Project

This repository contains a basic **Survey Form** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form collects user inputs such as name, email, hobby, favorite movie genre, mood, username, and date. It uses client-side validation techniques and was designed as part of a course assignment to practice form handling and front-end development.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:

- Create a responsive and accessible web form
- Practice input validation using HTML5 and JavaScript
- Apply regular expressions for pattern matching
- Simulate form submission using `https://httpbin.org/post`
- **Conduct a security audit** by identifying vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, weak validation, insecure patterns)

This form will be peer-reviewed for insecure coding practices as part of the **Final Project: Code Security Audit** for the course.

## Files

- `index.html` – Contains the structure of the survey form
- `styles.css` – Contains the styles to make the form responsive and visually appealing
- `script.js` – Handles client-side validation and error messages
- `README.md` – Project overview and audit purpose

## Security Audit

The project is being reviewed for:
- Input validation robustness
- HTML/JS security best practices
- Potential vulnerabilities such as XSS and data leakage

Peer review and Pull Request comments will be added to highlight any findings and improve the overall security posture of the form.

## Form Submission

For testing purposes, form submissions are posted to:
